				<p class="titulo-1">WHAT DO WE DO?</p>

	            <p class="titulo-6">EArte ALyC aims to catalog theses and dissertations on Environmental Education in Latin America and the Caribbean. To do this, we follow the following procedures:</p>

	            <p class="titulo-6">The theses uploaded to the online or offline Form (as the case may be) are those that have gone through - without exception - (i) the Excel sheet where the pre-selected theses are housed and (ii) the review of at least two principal researchers.</p>
	            
	            <p class="titulo-6">Once these two steps have been completed and approved by two principal researchers (in some cases: two internal researchers from the country, or pairs from different countries), they are authorized to be included in the EArte ALyC Database. The source of information for uploading to the online or offline Form is the summary of the thesis and dissertations.</p>
	            
	            <p class="titulo-6">We strictly follow the loading guidelines of the Form. It is very important for subsequent processing that the answers are loaded strictly in the requested format. We must always respect the writing as it appears in the original source (the thesis document), unless the form indicates otherwise.</p>
	            
	            <p class="titulo-6">We observe the use of capital letters, lowercase letters, and corresponding accents. If there is no information for a mandatory question, we enter triple zero in numbers: 000. We enter triple 000 in the "Other" option when the question has answer options and it is not possible to find the appropriate one. In cases of questions with multiple options, but it is not possible to classify the thesis with the provided categories, only mark the "Other" option and complete as appropriate.</p>

		            <p class="titulo-6">3.1. They refer to environmental issues or the foundations of environmental problems and their relationship with educational processes without including evidence of this relationship in the research process.</p>
		            <p class="titulo-6">3.2. Works that focus on various educational processes (e.g., special education, scientific education, artistic education, health education) and indicate the motivation, reasoning, or perspective of environmental education.</p>
